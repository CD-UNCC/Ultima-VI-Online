HOW TO PLAY

U6O "windows"
In U6O there are three types of "windows"
1. PARTY-STATUS window (displays sun, moons, wind, all party member's faces, hp, mp, and spellbook button)
2. INVENTORY window (seperate for each party member, displays ALL stats, equipped items, and inventory items, it can be hidden/displayed by clicking on the party member's face in the party-status window)
3. SPELLBOOK window (if a spellbook is equipped, this window appears, it can be hidden/displayed using the spellbook button in the party-status window)
ALL windows may be DRAGGED (moved to a different location) using the right mouse button. This is currently the only function of the right mouse button in U6O, all other actions use the left mouse button.

Moving items
To PICK UP an item, click on it (you must be standing next to it!), the item now appears on your mouse cursor
To DROP an item (currently being held on the mouse cursor) click on the place you wish to drop it
To ADD ITEM TO INVENTORY, drop it on the grid of 16 circles in your INVENTORY window
To WEAR an item, drop it on a circle in your INVENTORY window above the place on the "body" it should be worn (for example, boots need to be put on the circle on the "body"'s feet, your strength determines how much you can equip)
WARNING! Stealing items makes you lose KARMA (read about KARMA on website)
Picking up PARTIAL AMOUNTS of gold/torches/etc.
To SPLIT/PARTIALLY PICK UP an amount of an item:
i. HOLD SHIFT while typing the number/quantity you wish to pick up
ii. HOLD SHIFT and click on the group of items you wish to pick up
(for example, There are 100 gold nuggets on the ground! But I can only carry 85, so I hold shift and type the number 85, then (still holding shift, or holding it down again) I click on the pile of nuggets)

Using items
DOORS/LEVERS/CHESTS(to open them)/LADDERS/etc., press U then click on it
POTIONS/FOOD/FISHING ROD/etc., PICK UP the item (so that it is on your mouse cursor), press U (the item remains on the mouse cursor, but the cursor changes to the "use" cursor), then click on the person/place/item you wish to use it on (for example, food on a party member, fishing rod on ocean, rune on force field, empty bucket on a cow)

Looking at items
Press L then click on the item you want to LOOK at.
IMPORTANT! Look at items you wish to take, if it says "Taking this is stealing!" you will lose KARMA!

Looking INSIDE CHESTS/BAGS/etc.
Press L and click on the container.
If the container is IN YOUR INVENTORY you will look inside that container, otherwise everything inside that container will be extracted (taken out)

NOTE! Before you can cast you need to buy a spellbook, spell and reagents

Once you have a spell in your spellbook equip it and the SPELLBOOK window will appear
Click on the spell you wish to cast (the blue number shows how many times you can cast it with the reagents you have), then click on the place you wish to cast it
ADVANCED TECHNIQUE! Once you click on an attack spell, small numbers will appear above each target, press the number key instead of clicking on the target
COOL KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS! Click on the spell, then HOLD SHIFT and press a key from F5 to F12, the key is now a shortcut to that spell. By pressing the key (doesn't need shift), if you are holding a spellbook with that spell it will select it for casting!
